   - Factory Pattern
   - Builder Pattern

2. **Structural Patterns**
   - Adapter Pattern
   - Decorator Pattern

3. **Behavioral Patterns**
   - Observer Pattern
   - Command Pattern

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and clone the repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yagnitha18/EI_STUDY_ASSIGNMENT.git

2. **Navigate to the Desired Pattern Directory**
   
   Change into the directory of the design pattern you want to run. For example, to run the Builder
   pattern:

   ```bash
   cd Creational_Design_Pattern/Builder

3. **Compile the Java Files**

   Compile the java files using the javac command:

   ```bash
   javac *.java
